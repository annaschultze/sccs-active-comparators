# Active Comparators in Self-Controlled Studies (Work in Progress) 
This repo contains code needed to implement formal comparisons using active comparators in self-controlled studies, based on methods proposed by Hallas et al (2019). The aim is for this to host code in a variety of languages (Stata, SAS, R). For details please check out our white paper, accessible [placeholder] 

Please note that code will not cover data management required for different self controlled designs; only the analyses.
